| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |

delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date
and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate;
otherwise, it is called scheduled.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.


Create table If Not Exists Delivery (delivery_id int, customer_id int, order_date date, customer_pref_delivery_date date);
Truncate table Delivery;
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('1', '1', '2019-08-01', '2019-08-02');
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('2', '5', '2019-08-02', '2019-08-02');
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('3', '1', '2019-08-11', '2019-08-11');
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('4', '3', '2019-08-24', '2019-08-26');
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('5', '4', '2019-08-21', '2019-08-22');
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('6', '2', '2019-08-11', '2019-08-13');
