/**
 * 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck
 *
 * https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/
 *
 * You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck.
 *
 * You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
 *
 * numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
 * numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
 *
 * You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck.
 *
 * You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the numberÂ of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
 *
 * Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
