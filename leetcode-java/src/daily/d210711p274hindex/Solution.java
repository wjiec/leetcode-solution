 * 274. H-Index
 *
 * https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/h-index/
 *
 * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of
 * citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h
 * if h of their n papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
 *
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
